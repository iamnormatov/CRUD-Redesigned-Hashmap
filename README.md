CRUD stands for Create, Read/Retrieve, Update and Delete and these are the four basic operations that we perform on persistence storage. CRUD is data-oriented and the standardized use of HTTP methods. HTTP has a few methods which work as CRUD operations and do note they are very vital from a developmental point perspective in programming that also does helps us relate better web development and also aids us while dealing with databases. So, standard CRUD Operations are as follows:
``

``

GET: Reads/Retrieve a resource <br>
